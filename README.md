## Overview

The need to have short, easy-to-remember urls is the main major motivation behind Shotly. The app enable users create short, simple memorable urls, for various engagements on the internet. It provides a free, flexible customization options such that users get to decide what they want their shortened url to be. Long, complex urls can be shortened to just a single digit or letter using Shotly.

Shotly elegantly and seamlessly redirects request to any shortened url to their original target url; while also keeping tabs of the visitors statistics.

Users can manage their url. Users can redirect the target of their shortened url, deactivate and/or delete their them. Requests to deactivated and/or deleted shortened url will redirected with the appropriate error message.
